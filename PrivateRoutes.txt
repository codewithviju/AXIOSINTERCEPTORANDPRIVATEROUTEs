// Why we need Private Routes

-> bacause if we want to protect some page of our website were loged in user can access then we are used


// Example

import React from "react";
import { Navigate, Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const PrivateRoute = () => {
  const auth = localStorage.getItem("token");
  return auth ? <Outlet /> : <Navigate to="/login" />;
};

export default PrivateRoute;


// How To use 

{/* All Private Routes Will Be Here */}
        <Route exact path="/" element={<PrivateRoute />}>
          <Route exact path="/" element={<Home />} />
          <Route exact path="/about" element={<About />} />
        </Route>
